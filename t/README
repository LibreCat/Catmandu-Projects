Tests will only run after an instance of mongoDB is installed and running on the system. Also the /bin/importProjects.pl script needs to run once to import the test data from /bin/testRecsAnon.csv into the mongoDB (thereby creating the database).

Tests will change those test datasets during the testing process, add one record and delete another.

Use db.dropDatabase() on the mongoShell to clear the database of this test data after everything runs and before actual data is imported.
