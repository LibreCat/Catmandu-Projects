Catmandu-Projects version 0.01
==============================

Before installing this module, an instance of mongoDB needs to be running on the system.
If tests are to be run, the script /bin/importProjects.pl needs to be run with the test data in /bin/testRecsAnon.csv.
This script will create a new mongoDB called Projects and import five test records that will be altered by the module tests during the testing process. (To delete those test records and start with a fresh DB, use the db.dropDatabase() function on the mongo shell.))

   perl Makefile.PL

   make install
